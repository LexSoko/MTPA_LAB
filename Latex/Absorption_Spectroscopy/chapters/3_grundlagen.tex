    A laser operates by amplifying light through stimulated emission in a gain medium, fueled by an external energy source. 
    Optical feedback, often facilitated by mirrors within an optical cavity, promotes coherence. 
    Variations in laser design exist, but typically involve an output coupler and elements for beam manipulation. 
    These devices emit coherent light with controlled properties, akin to electronic oscillators. \\
    \subsubsection{Stimulated emission}
    Stimulated emission is a fundamental process in laser physics, characterized by the emission of a photon from an already excited atom when stimulated by the presence of a photon with frequency $\nu_{12}$ corresponding to the energy gap $\Delta E$ of the excited state to ground state transition. 
    Mathematically, the rate of stimulated emission is expressed as proportional to the number of atoms $N_2$ in the excited state and the radiation density of the light. 
    This relationship is encapsulated by the Einstein coefficients. 
    Specifically, the probability of a photon causing stimulated emission in a single excited atom is exactly equal to the probability of a photon being absorbed by an atom in the ground state. 
    This equality holds when the numbers of atoms in the ground and excited states are equal, resulting in a balanced rate of stimulated emission and absorption. \\
    For a laser to function effectively, the rate of stimulated emission must surpass that of absorption, necessitating a population inversion where $N_2$/$N_1$ > 1. 
    In other words, the population of the excited state must exceed that of the ground state.

    %\end{wrapfigure}
    This condition allows for the production of a continuously increasing number of photons, establishing optical gain within the laser medium.
    Understanding the interplay between absorption, stimulated emission, and population inversion is crucial for the design and operation of laser systems. 
    By harnessing stimulated emission and achieving population inversion, lasers can amplify light coherently, enabling applications ranging from scientific research to industrial manufacturing.

\subsection{Pulsed Lasers (Mode Locking)}
    % Describe pulsed lasers, their advantages, and limitations.
    % Discuss the concept of time-bandwidth limit and its relevance.
    Mode locking in optics is a technique used to generate ultra-short pulses of light in lasers, typically on the scale of picoseconds or femtoseconds. 
    By inducing a fixed phase relationship between the longitudinal modes of the laser's resonant cavity, constructive interference between these modes produces synchronized pulses. 
    This method, known as mode locking, alters the behavior of the laser's modes, causing them to periodically constructively interfere and emit intense bursts of light. 
    The pulse duration is determined by the number of locked modes and their frequency separation, governed by the laser's spectral width. 
    Mode locking enables precise control over pulse durations, with applications ranging from scientific research to industrial and medical fields.

\subsection{Second Harmonic Generation (SHG)}
    % Introduce SHG as a nonlinear optical process.
    % Explain how crystals generate light at twice the input frequency.
    % Discuss the importance of phase matching.
    Second-harmonic generation (SHG), or frequency doubling, is a fundamental nonlinear optical process where two photons with the same frequency interact in a nonlinear material, combining to generate a new photon with double the energy.
    This results in a photon with twice the frequency and half the wavelength of the initial photons,
    \begin{wrapfigure}[7]{r}[0cm]{0.4\textwidth}

        \caption{Second harmonic generation }
        
        \label{fig:shg:basic}
    \end{wrapfigure}
    conserving excitation coherence. SHG is utilized extensively, particularly in doubling laser frequencies, and is governed by the second-order nonlinear susceptibility of the medium. 
    While SHG is typically prohibited in media with inversion symmetry, exceptions exist, such as in non-centrosymmetric crystals. 
    Achieving efficient SHG often requires intense pulsed laser beams passing through large crystals with precise alignment for phase matching.

\subsection{Iodine Absorption \& Concentration}
    % Cover the absorption properties of iodine, including rotation, vibration, and temperature dependence.
    % Explain natural linewidth and temperature broadening effects.

Molecular iodine, which in the experiment described by the present document is examined in the gas phase as a diatomic molecule, exhibits absorption properties in the visible spectral range. These absorption properties, on one hand, arise due to the vibrational and rotational structure and the corresponding degrees of freedom of such molecules. On the other hand, electronic state transitions from ground states to excited states enable further absorption of specific wavelengths in the visible range \cite{demtroder2014laser}.

The absorption lines apparent in the absorption spectrum are expected to be slim and narrowly centered around the characteristic wavelengths corresponding to valid state transitions. There are a number of effects that lead to the broadening of these spectral lines, most importantly the intrinsic natural broadening arising from the finite lifetime of excited states. A second important effect is called temperature broadening, which results from the thermal motion of particles due to the Doppler effects. The latter effect only becomes apparent at high temperatures of the sample however \cite{demtroder2014laser}.

The decadic absorbance $A$ is described by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fundamentals:absorbance}
    A = \log_{10}\left(\frac{I_0}{I_t}\right) ,
\end{equation}
where $I_0$ is the measured laser intensity without iodine and $I_t$ is the intensity transmitted by the iodine \cite{demtroder2014laser}. For small molar concentrations $c$, the Lambert-Beer law relates the absorbance $A$ to the effective interaction length $l$ of the laser beam with the iodine and the molecular absorption coefficient $\varepsilon$ as follows \cite{attenuation}.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fundamentals:beer}
    A = l \cdot c \cdot \varepsilon
\end{equation}

The absorption cross-section $\sigma$ of iodine, which is a measure for the probability of an absorption process, commonly denoted in units of \si{\cm\squared\per\molecule} and available in scientific literature such as \cite{Iodine}, can be used to obtain the molecular absorption coefficient $\varepsilon$ via the relation
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fundamentals:absorptivity}
    \sigma = \frac{\ln(10) \cdot 10^3}{N_A} \cdot \varepsilon ,
\end{equation}
where $N_A$ is the Avogadro Constant \cite{attenuation}. The molecular absorption coefficient is commonly specified in units of \si{\liter\per\mol\per\cm} and - contrary to the absorbance $A$ - uses $e$ as logarithmic base, explaining the need for the term $ln(10) \cdot 10^3$ in Equation \ref{eq:fundamentals:absorptivity} due to base and unit conversion.


\subsection{Grating Spectrometer}
% Briefly mention grating spectrometers and their role in analyzing laser spectra.
% Explain how diffraction gratings disperse light for spectral measurements.

Spectrometers in general are optical instruments that create images which are laterally separated for different wavelengths $\lambda$ of the incident radiation. In the case of a grating spectrometer, as opposed to spectral dispersion used in a prism spectrometer, the lateral dispersion is due to diffraction plane or concave reflection gratings \cite{demtroder2014laser}.

In a grating spectrometer as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fundamentals:spectrometer}, the light source illuminates the entrance slit $S_1$, which is in the focal plane of a spherical mirror $M_1$. The collimated, parallel light is reflected by $M_1$ onto a reflection grating consisting of many straight grooves parallel to the entrance slit. Highly reflective metal or dielectric coating on the surface of the grating is used to reflect the light towards a second spherical mirror $M_2$, which in turn focuses it onto the exit slit $S_2$ or onto a photographic plate in the focal plane of $M_2$ \cite{demtroder2014laser}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{graphics/spectrometer.png}
    \caption{Schematic structure of a grating spectrometer \cite{demtroder2014laser}.}
    \label{fig:fundamentals:spectrometer}
\end{figure}

Considering the coherently illuminated grooves on the grating as individual sources of radiation, each of them diffracting the incident light into a larger range around the direction nof geometrical reflection, the resulting outgoing intensity is subject to destructive and constructive interference, where for the latter the grating equation is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fundamentals:grating}
    2 d \cdot \sin(\alpha) = m \lambda ,
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the width of each groove and $\alpha$ is the angle of the $m$-th order maximum at incident wavelength $\lambda$ \cite{demtroder2014laser}. From Equation \ref{eq:fundamentals:grating} follows the spectral resolving power as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fundamentals:resolving}
    R = \frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda} = m N ,
\end{equation}
for diffraction order $m$ with the total number $N$ of illuminated grooves \cite{demtroder2014laser}.

While using a prism spectrometer would have the advantage of unambiguous assignment of wavelengths $\lambda$, which is not the case for grating spectrometers due to histogram-like binning of wavelengths, the former offer only moderate spectral resolution compared to grating spectrometers. Also, since the current experiment involves infrared radiation, for which coated mirrors and gratings exhibit especially high reflectivity, grating spectrometers are preferred over prism spectrometers in such scenarios \cite{demtroder2014laser}.
