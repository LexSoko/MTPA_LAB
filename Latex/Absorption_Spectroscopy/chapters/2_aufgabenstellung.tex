\label{sec:Aufgabenstellung}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Characterization of a infrared laser via power meter and grating spectrometer.
    \item Setup of second harmonic generation (SHG) stage. Optimization for green power and characterization of conversion efficiency.
    \item Recording of SHG output spectrum via grating spectrometer.
    \item Recording of spectrum transmitted through iodine cell for three different temperatures in the range of \SI{20}{\celsius} to \SI{60}{\celsius}.
    \item Recording of spectrum transmitted through iodine cell at approximate temperature of \SI{60}{\celsius} when passing the cell three times. Comparison with single-pass spectrum.
    \item Plotting fundamental laser spectrum. Determination of corresponding central wavelength and full width half maximum (FWHM).
    \item Plotting the SHG spectrum. Determination of corresponding central wavelength and full width half maximum (FWHM).
    \item Calculation of absorbance of iodine at different temperatures and interaction lengths. Determination of the concentration in the cell based on the absorbance.
    \item Comparision of results with literature. Discussion of strategy for improving the experiment.
