%************AUSWERTUNG****************
\section{Results}
\label{sec:auswertung}
The evaluation is created with the scripting language \verb|Python| \cite{PYTHON}.
The Python libraries, \verb|numpy| \cite{harris2020array}, \verb|pandas| \cite{reback2020pandas}, \verb|scipy| \cite{2020SciPy-NMeth} and \verb|matplotlib| \cite{Hunter:2007}, are used for statistical calculation operations, reading and processing data and creating plots.
Exact function names that are used to calculate measured variables or fit parameters are specified in the further evaluation.
Furthermore, the library \verb|uncertainties| \cite{UN} is used for any uncertainty propagation (unless otherwise specified), as this is based on the principle of the maximum uncertainty method Eq. \ref{equ:groestunsicherheit} is based.
